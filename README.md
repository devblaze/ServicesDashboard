## ‚ö° Quick Install

### One-Line Install (Linux/macOS/Raspberry Pi)

Get started in seconds with our automated installer. The installer will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Detect your system architecture
- ‚úÖ Check system requirements (RAM, dependencies)
- ‚úÖ Install required .NET dependencies (ICU library, OpenSSL, CA certificates)
- ‚úÖ Download and configure the application
- ‚úÖ Set up systemd service for auto-start

**Raspberry Pi 3/4 (32-bit):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/nickantoniadis/ServicesDashboard/releases/latest/download/servicesdashboard-pi-linux-arm.tar.gz | sudo tar -xzf - && sudo bash install.sh
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Raspberry Pi Zero / Pi 1 NOT Supported:** .NET 9.0 does not support ARMv6 architecture (Raspberry Pi Zero, Pi 1). Please use Raspberry Pi 3 or newer (ARMv7/ARMv8). The Pi Zero has only 512MB RAM which is also insufficient for .NET applications. Minimum recommended: **Raspberry Pi 3 with 1GB+ RAM**.

**For other platforms:**
```bash
# Raspberry Pi 3/4 (32-bit)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/nickantoniadis/ServicesDashboard/releases/latest/download/servicesdashboard-pi-linux-arm.tar.gz | sudo tar -xzf - && sudo bash install.sh

# Raspberry Pi 4/5 (64-bit)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/nickantoniadis/ServicesDashboard/releases/latest/download/servicesdashboard-pi-linux-arm64.tar.gz | sudo tar -xzf - && sudo bash install.sh

# Linux x64
curl -fsSL https://github.com/nickantoniadis/ServicesDashboard/releases/latest/download/servicesdashboard-linux-x64.tar.gz | sudo tar -xzf - && sudo bash install.sh

# macOS (Intel)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/nickantoniadis/ServicesDashboard/releases/latest/download/servicesdashboard-macos-x64.tar.gz | tar -xzf - && sudo bash install.sh

# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/nickantoniadis/ServicesDashboard/releases/latest/download/servicesdashboard-macos-arm64.tar.gz | tar -xzf - && sudo bash install.sh
```

> **Note:** Replace `nickantoniadis` with your GitHub username if different. For a specific version, replace `latest/download` with `download/v0.0.1` (or your version number).

**After installation:**
```bash
# Start the service
sudo systemctl start servicesdashboard

# Check status
sudo systemctl status servicesdashboard

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u servicesdashboard -f

# Access the dashboard
# Navigate to http://your-ip:5050
```

**For Windows:**
Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nickantoniadis/ServicesDashboard/releases/latest) and run `install.ps1` as Administrator.

### üîß Troubleshooting Installation

If you encounter issues during installation, try these solutions:

**ICU Library Missing Error (Raspberry Pi/Linux):**
```
Process terminated. Couldn't find a valid ICU package installed on the system.
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu/DietPi
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libicu-dev libssl-dev ca-certificates

# RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
sudo yum install -y icu openssl-libs ca-certificates

# Alpine Linux
sudo apk add --no-cache icu-libs libssl3 ca-certificates

# After installing dependencies, restart the service
sudo systemctl restart servicesdashboard
```

**Service Fails to Start:**
```bash
# Check detailed logs
sudo journalctl -u servicesdashboard -n 50 --no-pager

# Verify service file exists
sudo systemctl status servicesdashboard

# Check if port 5050 is already in use
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 5050
```

**Insufficient Memory on Raspberry Pi:**
- Ensure you have at least 1GB RAM (Raspberry Pi 3 or newer)
- Close unnecessary services to free up memory
- Consider increasing swap space if needed
