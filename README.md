## ‚ö° Quick Install

### One-Line Install (Linux/macOS/Raspberry Pi)

Get started in seconds with our automated installer:

**Raspberry Pi 3/4 (32-bit):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/nickantoniadis/ServicesDashboard/releases/latest/download/servicesdashboard-pi-linux-arm.tar.gz | sudo tar -xzf - && sudo bash install.sh
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Raspberry Pi Zero / Pi 1 NOT Supported:** .NET 9.0 does not support ARMv6 architecture (Raspberry Pi Zero, Pi 1). Please use Raspberry Pi 3 or newer (ARMv7/ARMv8). The Pi Zero has only 512MB RAM which is also insufficient for .NET applications. Minimum recommended: **Raspberry Pi 3 with 1GB+ RAM**.

**For other platforms:**
```bash
